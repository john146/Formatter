# Formatter
Format xml files into readable files. Currently works on MacOS only, but can be readily ported to Linux. The driver for this
is the numerous machine generated XML and JSON files that are essentially a single line, making reading with human eyes difficult
to impossible.

Command line format Formatter -x <filename>
where:
  -x tells the formatter the file contains XML
  <filename> is the name, including path, to the file to format

Formatting JSON coming.
